Hello.
I recently noticed that the account called "MiniPandi" is impersonating me. As you might see, I registered the account Mini_Pandi a lot longer ago than the MiniPandi account exists, which is abused on public servers to spread misinformation and damage public trust. I use the name MiniPandi on social media platforms and even my website, minipandi.net. I will upload a copy of this exact message to https://minipandi.net/proof_of_ownership.txt as proof that I use the username "MiniPandi" everywhere else.
The Minecraft account MiniPandi was originally registered by someone else, and the account has been traded to a different person, who is also trying to sell the account now. I will attach an Image showing the current owner (randomdude187 on Discord) selling the account to me. The second screenshot contains a screenshot he sent to me proving that he is the owner of the MiniPandi account. Very recently, I also noticed the same original registrant of the "MiniPandi" account now has registered "MiniPandi_" which is also used to do the same harm to my online identity. The optimal scenario would be that I could register a new account with the name "MiniPandi" and "MiniPandi_" or just block these two names to stop further harm.
I hope that this can be resolved as soon as possible, since more and more people are distrusting me.
